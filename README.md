# MArmOS-Analyzer

WIP Script for game 'Space engineers' to generate configuration used by [MArmOS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=767595187) script.

My way to understand how MArmOS configuration works ... :) (unsuccessfuly)


- currently im able to resolve simple arms (no paraell blocks aka Hydraulic) block names and generate configurations for them

Known Bugs: 

- Axis resolution: i think its because sub grid have different orientation that parent grid
- Solids: im using block coordinates on its grid and asuming that block directly attached to parent head has coordinates [0,0,0]
